# Ball-Collision-Animation
- This is a simple code to demonstate a ball falling and collision animation
- I wanted to implement this just out of fun.
- Decided to implement this from scratch in **C** because that's what real men do ;)

## How to Use
- Complie
    - `gcc main.c -o falling_ball`

- Run
    - `./ falling_ball duration(in seconds) speed(in microseconds)`
    > eg: `./falling_ball 25 50`
